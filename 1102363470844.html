                     Businesses with tax debts need to be aware that the ATO will now be able to disclose the details of their tax debts to credit ratings agencies, which could potentially affect the ability of the business to obtain finance or refinance existing debt.

                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Generally, only businesses with an ABN and debts over $100,000 and that are not "effectively engaged" with the ATO will be affected. The ATO is planning a phased implementation which will consist of undertaking education efforts before it targets companies, followed by partnerships, trusts and sole traders.

                     The aim of the laws, according to the government, is to encourage more informed decision-making within the business community by making large overdue tax debts more visible, and to reduce the unfair advantage obtained by businesses that do not pay their tax on time.

                     <span style="font-size:10pt;">Crowdfunding has fast become a go-to strategy for people in need of large amounts of money quickly, but is the money raised considered to be income and therefore taxable?</span>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Crowdfunding is when an individual or business (the promoter) uploads a description of a campaign (eg to fund an activity, a project or a new invention) along with the amount they want to raise to a platform like Kickstarter, GoFundMe, Indiegogo or Pozible.
                     <br>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Other people online (the contributors) can then choose to support the campaign or cause by pledging money.
                     <br>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Many campaigns are donation-based. This is where contributors pledge an amount of money without receiving anything in return. If you're a contributor in this case, you won't be able to deduct an amount contributed in a crowdfunding campaign as a "donation" in your Australian tax return unless the cause you've donated to is an endorsed or legislated deductible gift recipient (DGR).
                     <br>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Other campaigns can be rewards-based. In these cases, the promoter provides a reward, such as goods, services or rights, to contributors in return for their payments. For example, differing levels of campaign-related merchandise may be available. Usually, your acquisition of goods or services for making a contribution means the payment is considered private in nature and not deductible.
                     <br>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     As the promoter of a campaign (either donation-based or rewards-based), whether the money you receive is considered to be taxable depends on the circumstances. Generally, if the campaign is related to running/furthering your business or is a profit-making plan, then any money received would be classed as income.
                     <br>

                     <span style="font-size:10pt;">The working holiday tax rate (commonly known as the "backpacker tax") has generally applied from 1 January 2017 to individuals who have working holiday or work and holiday visas. In essence, the first $37,000 of "working holiday taxable income" is taxed at 15%, and then the balance is taxed at the standard rates applicable to residents.</span>
                    </div> 
                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Thus, working holiday makers are taxed at a higher rate on their first $37,000 than residents, because the holiday makers don't get the benefit of the Australian tax-free threshold ($18,200 for 2019-2020).

                     A recent Federal Court case centred on a British citizen who lived in Australia for almost two years. During most of that time she lived in the same share house accommodation in Sydney, and only left for short stints to travel to other areas. Essentially, the case came down to whether or not she was a resident of Australia and if so, whether the non-discrimination clause in the Australia-United Kingdom double taxation agreement prevented her from being taxed at the higher "backpacker" rate. The Federal Court found that she was an Australian resident for tax purposes, and she should not be taxed at the higher rate.

                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     Some have seen this decision as a win for all working holiday makers, but it's likely to have a fairly narrow application. Coupled with the ATO still considering an appeal, this area of law is far from settled.

                     The allowance can also be in the form of fortnightly payments for a maximum period of four cumulative years at the same rate as the Newstart allowance. This allowance may be available to both the farmer and their partner, provided certain conditions are met. An activity supplement of up to $4,000 to pay for study, training or professional financial advice may also be available to eligible households.

                     In addition to the immediate assistance, primary producers can obtain ongoing benefits of various tax concessions, including the instant asset write-off, immediate deductions for fodder storage assets, and income averaging to assist with cash flow.

                     Under the superannuation guarantee framework, employers are required to contribute a minimum percentage (currently 9.5%) of their employees' ordinary time earnings into superannuation. Employers that fail to do so will be liable for a penalty called the superannuation guarantee charge, payable to the ATO. If you're a high-income earner with multiple employers, this requirement has the very real chance of pushing you over the concessional contributions cap of $25,000.

                    <div style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">
                     To avoid this unintended consequence, laws have recently been passed so that eligible high-income earners with multiple employers can opt out of the super guarantee regime. From 1 January 2020, employees with more than one employer who expect their combined employers' contributions to exceed the concessional contributions cap can apply for an "employer shortfall exemption certificate" with the ATO.
