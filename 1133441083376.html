  <br>I hope all is well, 
  <br> 
  <br>I just wanted to send over a quick email to check-in and see if you have any travel plans coming up that I can help you out with. 
  <br> 
  <br>We just partnered with eight of the worldÂs largest airlines and secured some super low-priced private contracts, so I figured IÂd reach out as It's always best to book ahead of time to get the best possible fares. Whether itÂs last minute or your booking way ahead of time, IÂd love to help plan your trip as your personal concierge. Also, If you have any friends or family that are planning to travel please send them my way and IÂll be happy to apply a significant credit on your next trip. 
  <br> 
  <br>When would be a good time in the next few days to chat about your next trip? 
  <br> 
  <br>Best, 
  <br>
