As a part of the program seniors are taught how to use their android phones, basic computers skills, and through TGH they are empowered to access and use digital tools to overcome barriers and advance their lives. As a result of this class seniors are able to understand the full functionality of their phone, navigate through the google apps, learn how to search through the web and connect with family using their phone. For many of the participants the class is life changing boosting both their confidence and their capacity to use technology. At the end of the class students have an opportunity to purchase a subsidized Chromebook.</p> </td>

Students go from consumers to programmers, and in the process, they reap the multiple benefits of a course designed to enhance student engagement, develop problem solving and critical thinking skills, engage students to make real-world connections, and develop a collaborative approach in order to succeed. The fall and spring programs served over 250 youth. Lego Robotics is a collaborative effort between TSN, Roxbury Robotics, and Northeastern University (NU) whose engineering students teach youth how to program the robots. WeDo 2.0 is the robotics program we offer to students 5-8 years old that brings to life 280 building elements that motivate students to collaborate, build, problem-solve, and explore, all while deepening their STEAM learning and developing 21st-century skills.</p> </td>

Nine students participated in the 30-year-old nationwide competition that engages youth to think like scientists and engineers. Teams were tasked with solving a Âreal-worldÂ problem and had to build, test, and program a robot to perform a series of tasks within a limited timeframe. We are proud that our team came in 25th place at the qualifier. Lego FLL is a collaborative effort between TSN, Roxbury Robotics, and Northeastern University (NU)engineering students</p> </td>
