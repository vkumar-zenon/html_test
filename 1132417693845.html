                <div>
                 Salama Aliekum!
                 <br>
                 <br>This is your brother Abdulahi Farah, greeting you with the greetings of Salam and wishing you full health and Eman. As you know, We have led a movement last year through the Muslim Coalition to Claim Our Voices, and because of the leadership of some in our community, we have reached 14,000 new voters and more Muslims voted than ever before. This began to send a message to elected leaders in MN that the Muslim Community is a powerful force in our politics and that they have no choice but to speak out and lead to end islamophobia and stand with us on our issues. BUT many politicians and political leaders tell a different story that the rise in Muslim voter turnout was a fluke, and was not because of our efforts.
                 <br>
                 <br>In order to demonstrate the political power of the Muslim Community in MN, we came up with few strategies. We are focusing on getting involved in some of the local races like city council and school board to turn out our people to scale before 2020. One of those strategies is to ensure that our community votes in the upcoming Saint Paul city elections! Why St.Paul? You may ask. We found that just three percent of Muslims in Minnesota voted in the last Saint Paul city elections. This is our capital and where big political players and decision makers live like our governor. If we want to have real power on our agenda at the city and state level, we need to demonstrate our capacity to get people in St Paul to the polls!
                 <br>
                 <br>Many politicians think this won't happen and this means that they are not leading in a real partnership with our community. Like I said many times before some want to scape goat us while others want to tokenize us in order to score political points. I've even heard people say things like "good luck finding Muslim voters in Saint Paul". If we can raise voter turnout in Saint Paul this election, we will prove that the unprecedented wave of Muslim engagement in 2018 was because of our leadership and it was just the beginning. We need to do this to send a message to candidates not only in Saint Paul but across Mn towards 2020.
                 <br>
                 <br>The election November 5th is about more than just city council. There is also referendum on the ballot in Saint Paul about whether they will keep our public trash program. We want our community to vote yes because if the vote is no, the property taxes might rise which in turn will raise the rent for many in our community. we believe that we are better off when we solve problems together and thats what the current trash system does instead of leaving our community to fend for themselves with corporations. 
                 <br>
                 <br>We also want to raise Muslim voter turnout through the roof in this election and turnout our community to Vote Yes so we can show that the Muslim community is a disciplined and unified force in politics.
                 <br>
                 <br>In some ways, whether we do this or not is the most important strategy to build Muslim independent Political power yet, because we are proving that we can turnout in a unified way in big numbers in an election (like St.Paul) where no one expect us to. This will send an important message.
                 <br>
                 <br>We can't do this without your help!
                 <br>
                 <br>So I'm emailing you to ask you to join us for at least two door knocks in the Muslim community in Saint Paul. We are going to be doorknocking different days between now and Election Day, and then we are going to talk to Muslim voters all through the final four days before the election to get out their vote.
                 <br>
                 <br>I'm asking you Today, this moment to commit to join us for at least 2 shifts in the next two weeks! and to join us at least one time in the final four days.
                 <br>
                 <br>I don't like to door knock as well, but I'm committed to do at least 5 shifts in this week and next week because I know how important this is for our community.
                 <br>
                 <br>I can sign you up if you reply with âcount me in â and with the days you are available. You can also click the link below to sign yourself up.
                 <br>
                 <br>Please join us? WE can only be as strong when we are all doing this together.
