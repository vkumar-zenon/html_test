                <span>Ruth and I have been on the road since the last week in October. This is been by far the busiest trip that I have had so far since I have begun doing deliverance once again. I had usually stopped to at least give people an idea of how to pray for us but my schedule has been so very full that I have not even had a chance to do that. I have even let many of my emails wait.&nbsp;</span>

                <span>I wish to pass along to all of you a very happy Thanksgiving! I have many more things to be thankful for then I can write in a letter, but suffice it to say for now that God has been very good and I am enjoying life and ministry of great deal these days. He has continued to supply my needs and we have seen a lot of the country that we usually fly over. It is been very enjoyable in that respect.</span>

                <span>We started out the &nbsp;last week in October attending an inspiring prophetic conference with James Nesbitt in Alabama. I got to hear a couple of lectures by our dear friend Lance Wallnau .&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lance is one of the most brilliant, refreshing &nbsp;speakers in our circles and it was such a joy to spend that week with him and his dear wife Annabel.&nbsp; We stayed up far too late one night having dinner together&nbsp; and renewing fellowship. I also had not heard Ray Hughes speak in a number of years and he is such a fascinating, refreshing speaker also.&nbsp; There was a doctor there who played the saw (yes, a regular hand crosscut saw). <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;" rel="nofollow" track="on" shape="rect" href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO0Vboq2Fq7a5G-odSbd-zdFCd2eUx9HdL5Q8emehulhElmnZvI1gQtruQS4QBq5A?key=Vm9qZjdQZGs4YnhqM3dKNjBuczNnSXBjZU1vSWNR" linktype="1" target="_blank">Video Link (Click to Watch)</a>&nbsp;</span>It takes such skill to bend the saw and use a violin bow and keep the melody right on key!&nbsp; I had not seen this in years.) &nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked to work in their prayer room, and when it was discovered that deliverance is my specialty, I was busy all of the rest &nbsp;of the waking hours&nbsp; praying for people. &nbsp;I prayed from early morning until quite late in the evening most days. While there I developed a cut a on a toe which immediately turned into an infection. However James was able to locate a wonderful doctor who took me and immediately and gave me antibiotics. It cleared up quite quickly. She did not mess around, but looked at the history of my septic legs in the past and decided to treat it aggressively. So we were very grateful.

                <span>From there we drove to Henderson, North Carolina. We met with "the Tribe"&nbsp; which is a group of young people in a House of Zion.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were over 20 people in that group. We had a seminar open to the public and it was very well attended. I did spend the next few days ministering to every one of the young people in the group.&nbsp; They treated us royally. Anthony, the patriarch of the group, spent most of his time helping Ruth do some repairs on the RV that had been on her "to do list"&nbsp; for a long time. He is an extremely skilled individual, and has renovated many houses. He I and his wife&nbsp; are &nbsp;parenting a number of young people in his tribe, and they are all magnificent young people. We met them at the Head of the Year conference in Denton and they invited us to Henderson so that's how this all began.&nbsp; A highlight of our trip was a day spent at The Cove, the Billy Graham conference center.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is &nbsp;a magnificent chapel and &nbsp;other meeting facilities in the midst of a gorgeous woods setting. Someone had arranged a tour for us and that was very special to me.</span>

                <span>From there we drove to Charlotte. &nbsp;We were hosted there by Mary, a Fuller Seminary graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another seminar and several days of ministering to individuals took place. It was a delightful time, and the folks worked very hard to make it a success. Two of the ladies (Ann and another Mary) that work very hard in the Carolinas, had set up a special guided tour of the Billy Graham Library. We spent a half a day there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so thrilled to view all of the memorabilia, walk through his childhood home, and especially see how much the dairy industry had played in his early life. It seemed to virtually parallel that of Peter's life! Once again, for some unknown reason,&nbsp; we were treated like royalty. They provided lovely luncheon for us, took us on a private tour through the whole structure, which looks like a dairy barn, and at the end when we were visiting the gift shop we were showered with gifts. I had brought some flowers along, just in case, and we were allowed to place them on Billy and Ruth Graham's gravesites. Ann and Mary &nbsp;had given me a beautiful bouquet of sunflowers and red carnations. We rearrange them to look like a spray and placed &nbsp;them on the graves with my vase of roses, carnations, and hydrangea.&nbsp;<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;" rel="nofollow" track="on" shape="rect" href="http://undefined" linktype="1" target="_blank">Link to Photo Gallery of our visit</a></span>

                <span>Charlotte will be hosting the Republican National Convention next August. Ruth and I were able to rent a campsite there very inexpensively. I am very exercised concerning the importance of the event. We plan to drive back out to Charlotte just to be on site to pray for that. Hotels are being built like crazy &nbsp;to host the event.</span>

                <span>From there we drove down to Valdosta,&nbsp; Georgia. We were once again with a House of Zion,&nbsp; led by Stephen and Kim Johnson. They have a large home and &nbsp;there were about 70 people, possibly more, in attendance. That met &nbsp;last Thursday evening, and I spent all of Friday, Saturday, Sunday and even Monday morning praying for a number of individuals from that church.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one of our more delightful stays, since it had warmed up quite a bit from North Carolina.&nbsp; They are accustomed to entertaining large groups of people in their home, so we had the opportunity of meeting and fellowshipping with most of them. By the time that was over, and I caught my breath, I realized that I was rather exhausted. Unfortunately we do not have photos from Valdosta.&nbsp; They have not arrived yet&nbsp;&nbsp; But Thank you, Kim, Steve and GOZ gang from The Deck!&nbsp;</span>

                <span>We left Georgia and it took us two days to arrive here in Vero Beach, Florida,&nbsp; where we met with Peter's sister for dinner last night. We plan on spending Thanksgiving with her. She is one of the most delightful persons on planet Earth and we so enjoy our time here. It is really warm and the weather has been very lovely. I have one more seminar to go in Orlando, which is a couple of hours drive &nbsp;away. I am not quite sure what their schedule will be, but I am toying with the idea of returning to Vero Beach if we can locate a place to park the RV. Things are very crowded here this time of year. I would love to have a little break of a few days rest and relaxation before heading back on the long drive to &nbsp;Texas. I have discovered that I am pretty worn out.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ruth and I both agree that we have to book things a little looser next time around.</span>

                <span>I have come to the conclusion that there are no where near enough deliverance ministers to meet the need.&nbsp; So I hope to continue to train as invitations and opportunities arise.&nbsp; I am feeling well although my hemoglobin is still only about 10.&nbsp; I try to stay on my soft food diet and find it is not really hard to do.&nbsp; Please continue to pray that my stomach be healed from bleeding.&nbsp; Ruth knocked out her back lifting boxes of books yesterday, but found a chiropractor and got an adjustment so is feeling some better this morning.&nbsp; The RV is running fine, and we have enjoyed driving and seeing some fall foliage.</span>
